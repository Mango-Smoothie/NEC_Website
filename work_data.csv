Food Sovereignty Report | spotlight,"Last summer, Emily Braddock ’22 began a research project examining community perspectives on food justice and food sovereignty in Worcester. With support from A new Earth conversation and the ClarkCONNECT fellows program, she began interviewing community partners involved with food access work in the city to survey what is currently happening here, with an eye to further pathways toward food sovereignty for all.

While completing her project, Emily was actively involved in bringing these conversations to campus. In October, she worked with LEEP Fellows Kathryn Jeffreys and Adeline Hebert to host a community dialogue on the intersections between racial, climate, and food justice. Further dialogues on these issues are being planned for the coming year.

Food Sovereignty in Worcester: Community Understandings and Possibilities for Action

In your report, you write that food sovereignty offers a transformative approach to our market-based food system, and “does not only demand the right of all people to food access… [but] demands the right of all people to have control over the means of that food access” (p. 5). Why do you think this framework is so critical now?  

With the COVID pandemic right now, we’re seeing food insecurity rise not only globally but also here in Massachusetts. What’s deadly about food insecurity right now especially, is that it is tied to diet-related illness and obesity, which contribute to adverse outcomes if you get COVID. I think the food sovereignty framework is so important during this time because it helps people to see that this is not just an issue of access, but rather an issue of who has control over the food system. The reason food deserts exist in the US, is because chain grocery stores, which dominate the food sales landscape, won’t set up shop in impoverished communities because of the crime risk, etc. And the reason the cheapest and most readily available foods in grocery stores are also the most unhealthy, is because the US Department of Agriculture subsidizes industrial crops like corn, soy, and wheat. I think the food sovereignty framework is important because it shows us that putting our food system in the hands of communities, by supporting small grocers, local farmers, and community-food cooperatives, is one of the best ways to combat the systemic injustices we’re dealing with around food.

I also think food sovereignty is really critical right now because of the climate crisis. Industrial agriculture puts large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere and is a less understood contributor to the climate crisis. However, the food sovereignty framework prioritizes supporting small farmers. The more we can support small farmers, the more resilient and equitable our food system will be.

Looking back to when you started this research, what new questions have emerged for you through this process?  

One of the biggest questions that’s emerged for me is: what strategies can we use to increase community stakeholdership in the US food system? A lot of the folks I interviewed work for great programs in Worcester that are certainly trying to make the food system more just. However, aside from a few initiatives like YouthGrow (through the Regional Environmental Council), most are led by people who are not directly impacted by food insecurity. One interviewee mentioned that they’ve struggled to incorporate more diverse community leadership in their work. I think we need examples and case-studies from other places in the US on how to make this work. Another question that I’m interested in pursuing further, is what sort of knowledge base there is around purchasing local or organic foods, or growing your own food, in Worcester. Some of my interviewees said they think a lot of immigrants in Worcester have a knowledge of healthy eating and growing food for home consumption. Doing some kind of systematic survey to document this knowledge would be helpful in determining what programs are needed moving forward.

How has this research shaped your own thinking on food sovereignty and the work you’d like to do moving forward?   

This research really opened my eyes to the difficulties of achieving food sovereignty in the US. I think part of the challenge is that in the US, there are so many layers of separation between average citizens and the actors and interests that control the food system. For example, if you have a lower-income individual who receives Healthy Incentive Program (HIP) benefits, then they have more agency over their food access than they would have normally, and the local food economy is supported. That strengthens the possibility of community food sovereignty. But if you’re really trying to achieve a food sovereign system, then the community itself would ideally be controlling HIP benefits and deciding what foods are eligible, rather than the government. Moving forward, I’m interested in doing more research on cooperative food economies in New England, which I think is about the closest anything has gotten to food sovereignty here in the US. After finishing school, I also hope to travel overseas to learn from individuals working in the food sovereignty movement there, particularly Southeast Asia.

How did the community interviews impact the direction of this project?  

The community interviews really helped shape the interview questions I used. I started out with interview questions that were very broad, like “what populations does your organization serve?” and “how would you like to see your organization’s work grow over the next five years?”  But then I sat down for my first interview, and my interviewee had such a wealth of knowledge and expertise on the Worcester food system, and I really wanted to tap into that. So I started asking more sophisticated questions about the food system, like “what is your theory of change for the Worcester food system?” and “what do you think needs to happen for Worcester to achieve more food sovereignty/food justice?” And this really shaped how I structured my report in the end. I think that’s probably typical in research, where you go in with one set of questions that you think are important, but then once you start talking to people, realize these aren’t the questions you want to be asking at all. In general, my interviewees opened my eyes to a whole world of food advocacy in Worcester, which inspired me to keep going throughout this project.

What do you hope our Clark community will take away from this research?  

One of the things I hope the Clark community will take away from this research, is that there’s a lot we can do here at Clark to support the movement for food sovereignty. Clark is an important stakeholder in the local food system, and if Clark were to adopt practices that support the local food economy, including locally owned restaurants, this could have reverberating effects on the strength of the community food system in this entire region. In my report, I talk about how other schools in New England like UMass Amherst source a large percentage of their food locally. In the case of UMass Amherst, this was spearheaded by student activists. I hope that after reading this report, students and faculty in our Clark community will be excited to organize around food sovereignty at Clark. By increasing the control that we as students, faculty, and members of the Clark community have in determining the Clark food system, we would actually be asserting food sovereignty on a micro level. In my report, I discuss different ideas for organizing around food sovereignty here at Clark, as well as ideas for community action research.

Balancing forests and development | spotlight,"NEC Lead Convener Denise Humphreys Bebbington and Core Advisory member Anthony Bebbington are lead authors on the newly launched 2020 New York Declaration on Forests (NYDF) Assessment Report on Goals 3 & 4. The report Balancing forests and development: Addressing infrastructure and extractive industries, promoting sustainable livelihoods launched November 19th.

This NYDF Assessment report finds that massive planned infrastructure, mining, and other extractive projects threaten tropical forests while failing to serve local communities. The report offers four strategies for progressing on Goals 3 and 4 to halt global deforestation.

Additional contributing authors include Andrea Cabrera Roa, Nicholas Cuba, Pilar Delpino Marimon, and Laura Sauls, all current and former PhD students of the Clark University Graduate School of Geography.

Governing Extractive Industries | spotlight,"NEC Lead Convener and Associate Research Professor, Denise Humphreys Bebbington co-authored a book (first published in English and Spanish, 2019) that has recently been translated into Chinese by Weijun Xie and published by the University of International Business and Economics Press in China.

The book, entitled Governing Extractive Industries: History, Ideas, Politics, is co-authored by Anthony Bebbington (GSG,Clark University), Abdul-Gafaru Abdulai (University of Ghana), Marja Hinfelaar (Southern African Institute for Policy and Research, Zambia), Denise Humphreys Bebbington (IDCE, Clark University) and Cynthia Sanborn (Universidad del Pacífico, Peru)

Professor Bebbington writes: “The significance of the book being published in Chinese reflects the increased presence and role of Chinese financing agencies and companies in natural resource extraction and infrastructure development in both Latin America and Africa.”

 

Professor Anthony Bebbington from the Graduate School of Geography was interviewed in 2019 upon its initial release:

Please briefly describe the book, as well as larger thematic meanings.
This book is a joint authored collaboration with our colleagues Abdul-Gafaru Abdulai of the University of Ghana, Marja Hinfelaar of the Southern African Institute for Policy and Research in Zambia, and Cynthia Sanborn of the Universidad del Pacífico in Peru.

The book compares the governance of extractive industries – mining and hydrocarbons – across Bolivia, Ghana, Peru and Zambia, and does so over what we call the “longue durée”, from the end of the 19th century to the present. It attempts to see overarching patterns in these different experiences, with a particular focus on the ways in which political relationships affect extractive industry governance and also how in turn natural resources influence politics. On that basis, we also try to contribute to theories of the politics of development. We pay particular attention to the political settlements that are crafted among national elites and how these have influenced the core principles underlying mineral policy and the use of natural resource “rents” (the sometimes super-profits that derive from controlling mining, oil and gas production).  Drawing comparisons over such long periods and across Africa and Latin America is not common in such work, and we were each surprised, I think, by how much similarity there was among countries, and how much global histories also affected these patterns.

Discuss your motives for writing this book.  What is the most important message you are seeking to broadcast?
At one level the message is an obvious one, but sometimes one that I (at least) can lose sight of in my work on social movements, rural livelihood strategies and civil society organizations: namely that the structure and maneuvers of elite politics are really important for setting the stage on which conflicts over natural resources unfold. We would argue that one needs more than good political economy analysis to understand these elite politics, and also – on a much more practical level – that efforts by activists, international donor agencies,  philanthropy and others to influence natural resource governance must work from an understanding of these elite politics (in order to identify strategies more likely to succeed), and ideally engage directly with these elite politics, risky as that can be.

My motives were fourfold. First, this was a new theoretical approach and a new literature for me, and that was challenging. Second, I believe the topic is important for approaches to social justice work, even if the theory can feel abstracted from grant-making and activism. Third, it was a chance to collaborate with some wonderful colleagues. Fourth, I value my relationship with colleagues at the University of Manchester’s Global Development Institute, and this was a chance to continue that relationship as we won research resources from their Effective States and Inclusive Development program to support the work.

Who is your ideal audience for it?
Inevitably a book like this will be read primarily by students and researchers.  However, we believe that the theme and conclusions have significance for those aid, philanthropic and social change organizations that take the politics of development seriously. Colleagues at the Ford Foundation have, for instance, already commented on pre-published versions of the text.

The book, which is under translation in Spanish, makes an important contribution to debates about the politics of natural resource extraction in Andean countries and more generally in Latin America.  It will be helpful to students and researchers but also to those working in international development organizations, non governmental organizations and government officials who are actively engaged with natural resource governance issues.

Did you do many site visits for your research? Can you describe these trips?
For all five of us, this was a book that was about stepping back from site visits and the details of local research and, instead, trying to interpret the more opaque and structural politics the drive natural resource governance.  We each did interviews with key informants, of course, and read a lot of material. But more importantly this was an attempt to step back and ask, beyond the noise of particular conflicts, investment projects and policy debates, “what is really going on here”?

What kind of research did you do, and how long did you spend researching before beginning the book?
I have been involved in work on natural resource governance in the Andean countries since 1986, and on mining and hydrocarbons since 2004.  Denise’s history is similar, but she has worked on extractive industries and socio-environmental movements and social justice for longer, since 2001 through her work as Latin American Coordinator for Global Greengrants Fund.  Cynthia’s involvement in Peru stretches back even longer (she is now Peruvian) and also combines social justice and academic rsearch. and Marja’s research in Zambia stretches back for a similar period, Abdul-Gafaru’s in Ghana a little less (he is the young one among us!). In some sense, all this history of research and grant-making (for Denise and Cynthia) feeds into this book.

What is your next project?  How does this publication tie into your research goals?
As we were writing this book, Denise and I, together with Professor John Rogan, PhD student Laura Sauls, and master’s and undergraduate students at Clark, as well as colleagues in Central America, Brazil, Peru and Indonesia were involved in a study of the role of extractive industry and large-scale infrastructure development in processes of forest loss, forest degradation, and violation of the rights of forest dependent communities. That project has been at least as overwhelming as this book, and Denise has done an incredible amount of work bringing it to a close. Putting both projects to bed at the same time took an unreasonable toll on family life.  So, the next project needs to be more modest.

That said, I am getting involved in work on the relationships among mining, water governance and development disputes under conditions of climate change in Latin America and SE Asia. A critical sub-question in that research is that of coal mining in Indonesia and Colombia. Coal is such a difficult question, but it is often so clearly linked to forest loss, rights abuses, corruption and greenhouse gas emissions that, in many locations, neither it, nor investment in it, can possibly be justified. And related to this is the plan to establish a new center for work on extractive industries, society and environment which can help give greater profile to faculty and student work on these issues and serve to link this work more organically with the sorts of organizations with whom we have been collaborating over the years. That is exciting, and challenging too.

We have been able to make this book open access, thanks to support from the UK Department for International Development, via the Effective States and Inclusive Development program at the University of Manchester.

That same support has also made it possible for us to produce a Spanish language version of the book, to be published the University Press of the Universidad del Pacífico in Peru.  This will also be open access. Though it implies a lot of extra time, we take Spanish language publication of our research very seriously and it is always satisfying to see our Spanish language work on university syllabi in Latin America.",spotlight_governing_extractive_industries.png,,
Recent Publication | spotlight,"NEC Lead Convener, Denise Humphreys Bebbington and Core Advisory Member, Tony Bebbington are among the authors of a recent article published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In their piece “Priorities for governing large-scale infrastructure in the tropics” they warn that large-scale infrastructure projects in tropical countries are undermining efforts to prevent climate change and biodiversity loss and enhance community land and resource rights. They propose an alternative framework for infrastructure development, premised on human and environmental well being.

Traina exhibit | spotlight,"This February, A new Earth conversation and the Council on the Uncertain Human Future celebrated the opening of “The Uncertain Human Future: A participatory exhibit” in the Traina Center for the Arts. The night of the opening, CUHF Lead Convener Sarah Buie and Walter Wright (Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy) convened an Evening of Council with several of their Council Collaborative students participating.

Nivo

The exhibit itself offers a spotlight on the questions asked in the Council on the Uncertain Human Future: What is taking place on the planet? Why is it happening? And given what we know, how do we live now?

With a collection of notes spanning over four years, the exhibit makes visible this process of reflection that our students and faculty continue to hold at Clark. Reflecting on the exhibit, Dimitri Koufis shared this hope:

The climate crisis goes far beyond CO2 levels; we are in a time of ecological, social, and economic crisis, and these are deeply intertwined. ‘Addressing’ these crises takes a broader lens than we are used to. I hope this exhibit can give anyone engaging with the material a glimpse of the intertwined nature of the climate crisis and the opportunity for unconventional thinking in addressing any and all concerns posed in the exhibit.”

Many thanks to Dimitri Koufis for supporting with the installation of the exhibit, and to the many students, faculty, and Council partners whose reflections contributed to this body of work.
